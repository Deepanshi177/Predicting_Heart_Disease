# Predicting_Heart_Disease

Scenario: 
You have just been hired as a Data Scientist at a Hospital with an alarming number of patients coming in reporting various cardiac symptoms. A cardiologist measures vitals & hands you this data to perform Data Analysis and predict whether certain patients have Heart Disease. We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. Thus, we would want to classify patients as either positive or negative for Heart Disease.

Goal: 
Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome. Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy. Examine trends & correlations within our data Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis
